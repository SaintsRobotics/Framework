# 4 Task Interface

## Context

The Task Framework from ADR#1 does not contain a formal method for Tasks to communicate with each other. If tasks cannot communicate, code reuse and redundancy often occurs, resulting in less readable code.

## Decision

We will write a class that contains static fields that tasks can manipulate to communicate with each other.

## Status: Accepted, implementing

## Consequences 
 - Pending
